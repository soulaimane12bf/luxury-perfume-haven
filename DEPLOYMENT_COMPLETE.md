## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Check that `POSTGRES_URL` or `DATABASE_URL` is set in environment variables
- Neon Postgres connection should be automatic from Vercel Storage integration

### Seeding Doesn't Work
- Make sure `SEED=true` is set
- Check function logs for any errors
- Database tables must exist (Sequelize creates them automatically)

### API Returns 503
- Database is not connected or not reachable
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Redeploy after adding variables

### Admin Login Fails
- Make sure you've redeployed after adding `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- Check that database seeding completed successfully
- Try resetting the password via database directly if needed
