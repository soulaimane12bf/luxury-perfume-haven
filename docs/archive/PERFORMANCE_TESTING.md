# 🧪 Performance Testing Guide

## How to Verify the Optimizations

### 1. Check Bundle Size Improvements ✅

The build output shows our success:
```
Before: dist/assets/index-C68N7pUP.js    492KB (150KB gzipped)
After:  dist/assets/index-DaoFRlXR.js    394KB (125KB gzipped)

Result: 20% smaller main bundle! 🎉
```

### 2. Verify Code Splitting 🔀

Look at the build output - you should see separate chunks:
```
✅ ProtectedRoute-D_2KsTWt.js    0.28 kB
✅ Login-QunGRxzz.js             1.46 kB
✅ BestSellers-BIH2341f.js       2.08 kB
✅ ProductSingle-Bu87jhxt.js    10.57 kB
✅ Collection-8yzBNKDo.js       17.86 kB
✅ AdminNew-BeGvn105.js          62.37 kB  ← Admin only loads when needed!
✅ index-DaoFRlXR.js           394.68 kB  ← Main bundle
```

### 3. Test Data Caching 💾

**Test Flow:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Visit homepage → Should see API call to `/api/products`
3. Navigate to Collection page → Should see NO duplicate products call (cached!)
4. Go back to homepage → Should load instantly (cached!)
5. Refresh homepage → If < 5 minutes, uses cache (no API call)

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ First visit: Makes API call
- ✅ Subsequent visits within 5 minutes: Uses cache
- ✅ After 5 minutes: Refetches fresh data

### 4. Test Loading Skeletons ⏳

**Test:**
1. Open homepage (throttle network to "Slow 3G" in DevTools)
2. Should see animated skeleton cards while loading
3. Navigate to Collection page
4. Should see skeleton loaders instead of "Loading..." text

**Expected:**
- ✅ Beautiful animated skeleton cards
- ✅ No layout shift when data loads
- ✅ Professional loading experience

### 5. Test Lazy Loading Images 🖼️

**Test:**
1. Open Collection page with many products
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Filter by "Img"
4. Scroll down slowly

**Expected:**
- ✅ Images only load as you scroll near them
- ✅ Not all images load at once
- ✅ Network tab shows progressive image loading

### 6. Test Code Splitting Routes 📦

**Test Admin Panel Lazy Loading:**
1. Open homepage
2. Open DevTools → Network tab → Filter by "JS"
3. Should NOT see `AdminNew-*.js` file
4. Navigate to `/admin`
5. NOW should see `AdminNew-BeGvn105.js` loading

**Expected:**
- ✅ Admin panel only loads when accessed
- ✅ Saves 62KB for regular users

### 7. Performance Metrics 📊

**Test with Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools):**
1. Open DevTools → Lighthouse tab
2. Select "Performance" + "Desktop/Mobile"
3. Click "Analyze page load"

**Target Scores:**
- ⚡ Performance: 85+ (was ~65-70 before)
- 🎨 First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- ⏱️ Time to Interactive: < 3s
- 📦 Total Bundle Size: ~394KB (down from 492KB)

### 8. Real-World User Experience Test 👤

**Simulate Real Usage:**

**Scenario A - New Visitor:**
1. Open homepage (clear cache first)
2. Time: Should load in 2-3 seconds
3. Homepage shows skeleton → Products appear

**Scenario B - Returning Visitor:**
1. Visit homepage again (within 5 minutes)
2. Time: Should load near-instantly (<500ms)
3. Products appear immediately from cache

**Scenario C - Navigation:**
1. Homepage → Collection → Product → Back
2. Going back should be instant (cached data)
3. No "Loading..." delays

### 9. Check React Query DevTools (Development) 🛠️

**In Development Mode:**
The React Query DevTools will show in bottom-right corner (if enabled).

**Check:**
- ✅ See query cache status
- ✅ See active queries
- ✅ See stale/fresh data indicators
- ✅ Manually refetch to test

### 10. Mobile Performance Test 📱

**Test on Mobile:**
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Select mobile device (iPhone/Android)
4. Test all flows

**Expected:**
- ✅ Smooth scrolling
- ✅ Fast navigation
- ✅ 2-column grid works perfectly
- ✅ Images load progressively

## 🎯 Success Indicators

You've successfully optimized if you see:

- ✅ Bundle size reduced to ~394KB
- ✅ Multiple chunk files in build output
- ✅ No duplicate API calls in Network tab
- ✅ Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- ✅ Instant navigation on cached pages
- ✅ Admin panel loads separately
- ✅ Images load progressively on scroll
- ✅ Lighthouse Performance score > 85

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If caching doesn't work:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify QueryProvider wraps App in main.tsx
- Check Network tab for 200 (from cache) responses

### If code splitting doesn't work:
- Verify lazy() imports in App.tsx
- Check build output for separate chunks
- Clear browser cache and rebuild

### If skeletons don't show:
- Check isLoading state in components
- Verify ProductCardSkeleton component exists
- Test with network throttling enabled
