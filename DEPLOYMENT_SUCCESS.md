## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. Clean Up Old Sliders (IMPORTANT!)

Go to your **Admin Panel** and delete all existing sliders:

```
https://your-production-url.vercel.app/admin
→ Login
→ Go to "السلايدر" tab
→ Delete all old sliders (they have base64 images)
```

### 2. Create New Sliders

Now create new sliders with file uploads:

```
→ Click "إضافة شريحة جديدة"
→ Upload an image file (JPG/PNG)
→ Fill in title, subtitle, etc.
→ Click "حفظ"
```

**The image will now be uploaded to Vercel Blob Storage!** 🎉

### 3. Verify It Works

Check:
- ✅ Image uploads successfully
- ✅ Slider displays on homepage
- ✅ Image loads from `*.vercel-storage.com`
- ✅ Console shows: "✅ Image uploaded successfully"

| Image Delivery | Database | Vercel CDN |

## 🔍 How to Monitor:

### Check Vercel Dashboard:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is not configured"
**Solution**: Already fixed! Token is configured.

### Issue: Images still showing as base64
**Solution**: Delete old sliders and create new ones.
