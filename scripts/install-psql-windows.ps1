<#
Install or make psql available on Windows.

This helper tries to detect common package managers (winget or chocolatey) and
offers the commands to install PostgreSQL (which provides the psql client).

Notes:
- Installation usually requires Administrator privileges. Run PowerShell as
  Administrator (right-click -> Run as Administrator) if you want the script
  to perform the install automatically.
- If you can't run elevated, the script prints copyable commands to run
  manually (or you can use Docker as an alternative if you have Docker).

Usage:
  # Run interactively
  pwsh .\scripts\install-psql-windows.ps1

After install, reopen your terminal and run `psql --version` to verify.
