# ⚠️ Vercel Serverless Function Limitation

## Issue Summary

The application has hit the **Vercel Hobby Plan limit of 12 serverless functions**. This means some deeply nested API routes (like `/api/products/:id/best-selling`) return 404 errors.

---

## What's Working ✅

- ✅ `/api/health` - Health check
- ✅ `/api/categories` - List categories
- ✅ `/api/products` - List products (with filters)
- ✅ `/api/reviews/product/:id` - Get reviews (we created a specific handler before hitting the limit)
- ✅ `/api/auth/login` - Admin login
- ✅ `/api/orders` - Order management
- ✅ All single-level API routes

---

## What's NOT Working ❌

- ❌ `/api/products/:id` - Get single product
- ❌ `/api/products/:id/best-selling` - Toggle best-selling status (PATCH)
- ❌ Any other deeply nested routes requiring dynamic segments

---

## Why This Happens

Vercel's Hobby plan limits projects to **12 serverless functions**. Each file in the `/api` directory counts as one function:

1. `/api/[...slug].js` - Main catch-all
2. `/api/reviews/product/[productId].js` - Reviews handler  
3. Frontend rewrites and other Vercel internals

The file-system based routing requires separate handler files for nested routes, which quickly exhausts the limit.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade to Vercel Pro (Recommended)
**Cost**: $20/month per team member  
**Benefits**: 
- Up to 100 serverless functions
- Better performance
- More build minutes
- Team collaboration features

**How to upgrade**:
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/marwanelachhabs-projects/luxury-perfume-haven/settings)
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
3. Redeploy with all the handlers we created earlier

### Option 2: Use API Routes Directly (Current Workaround)
For admin functions that don't work via the web UI, use the API directly with tools like:

#### Using curl:
```bash
# Toggle best-selling status
curl -X PATCH https://luxury-perfume-haven.vercel.app/api/products/armaf-club-de-nuit/best-selling \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

# Get single product
curl https://luxury-perfume-haven.vercel.app/api/products/armaf-club-de-nuit
```

#### Using Postman/Insomnia:
1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
2. Import the API endpoints
3. Add your JWT token to requests
4. Make requests directly

### Option 3: Deploy Backend Separately
Deploy the Express backend to a different platform that doesn't have function limits:

**Platforms**:
- **Railway**: Free tier, no function limits
- **Render**: Free tier, traditional server deployment
- **Fly.io**: Free tier for small apps
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: $5/month

**Steps**:
1. Deploy backend separately to one of these platforms
2. Update frontend API URL to point to new backend
3. Keep frontend on Vercel
4. No function limits!

### Option 4: Modify Admin Panel to Use Working Routes Only
Update the admin panel UI to:
- Remove "best-selling toggle" from product list view
- Use product edit form to change best-selling status
- Fetch products via list endpoint instead of single product endpoint

---

## Recommended Action Plan

**Short Term** (Today):
1. Document which admin features don't work
2. Use curl/Postman for missing features
3. Consider deploying backend separately (Option 3)

**Long Term** (This Week):
1. Evaluate if $20/month Pro plan makes sense for your business
2. OR deploy backend to Railway/Render for free
3. Remove function limit headaches

## Current Deployment Status

### Working Features:
- ✅ Full frontend (home, products, categories, cart, etc.)
- ✅ Public product browsing
- ✅ Admin login
- ✅ Product listing in admin
- ✅ Category management
- ✅ Order viewing
- ✅ Reviews display

### Limited Features:
- ⚠️ Single product API endpoint
- ⚠️ Best-selling toggle in admin
- ⚠️ Some admin edit functions requiring nested routes

---

## Technical Details

### Why Can't We Use One Catch-All?

Vercel's file-system routing works like this:
- `/api/[...slug].js` matches `/api/*` (one level)
- But does NOT reliably match `/api/products/id/nested` (multiple levels)
- Each distinct route pattern needs its own file
- Hobby plan: max 12 files
- We need ~15-20 files for full functionality

### What We Tried:
1. ✅ Single catch-all - works for simple routes
2. ❌ Nested catch-alls - hit 12 function limit  
3. ❌ Rewrite rules - broke routing completely
4. ❌ Dynamic route matching - Vercel doesn't support it on Hobby

## Next Steps

**Choose your path**:

1. **Quick Fix** (Free, 10 minutes):
   - Deploy backend to Railway
   - Update `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel
   - Everything works!

2. **Professional** ($20/month):
   - Upgrade to Vercel Pro
   - Redeploy with all handlers
   - Fully integrated solution

3. **Workaround** (Free, requires technical knowledge):
   - Use Postman/curl for admin functions
   - Live with limitations
   - Good enough for testing

## Files for Reference

- Current working handler: `/api/[...slug].js`
- Vercel config: `/vercel.json`
- Removed handlers (in git history): `api/auth/`, `api/products/`, etc.

**Need help deciding?** Consider:
- **Budget**: Free → Railway/Render
- **Simplicity**: All-in-one → Vercel Pro  
- **Testing only**: Workaround → Postman/curl

---

**Status**: Application is 90% functional. Core e-commerce features work. Some admin convenience features require workaround or upgrade.
